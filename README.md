--------------------------------

# To run data engineering pipeline
### Install Requirements - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
### Run Code - `python3 main.py`

--------------------------------
FYI - Procfile is mainly used for Heroku Deployment - Heroku Deployment currently turned off - can be turned on and can give access if required. Please let me know by preferably emailing me @ rahulkumaran313@gmail.com or by creating an issue.

ALL AWS credentials in the code are active for now. Credentials not masked or encrypted.
Credentials in plain sight so that reviewers can run them locally without any hindrance and additional set up.
QuickNode credentials NEED NOT to be changed - sufficient free API calls available.

--------------------------------
# To run jupyter notebook
`jupyter notebook` -> Then click on `Uniswap Analysis.ipynb` file once Jupyter opens up on browser

Please ensure Jupyter is installed.

Also, Infura endpoint is being used within Jupyter notebook - has a few free API calls left - but if you get some errors, please feel free to use another Infura or QuickNode endpoint by replacing the existing one or ask me to replace the endpoint by letting me know via email @ rahulkumaran313@gmail.com
